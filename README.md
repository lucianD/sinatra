This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It has also a server side in ruby/sinatra
 
## Running scripts

**start the client:** `npm start`

**start the server:** `npm run server`

## DB

**The actual data is read from a data.json file that should be placed in /src/server** (doing this because I cannot access the API url from my location)
