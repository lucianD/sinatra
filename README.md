This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It has also a server side in ruby/sinatra

## Installation
go to root directory and run 

`npm install` 

`bundle install --path vendor/bundle`
 
## Running scripts 
hint: you run all commands from root directory

**start the client:** `npm start`

**start the server:** `npm run server`

**start front-end tests:** `npm run test`

**start back-end tests:** `npm run test-server`

## DB

**The actual data is read from a data.json file that should be placed in /src/server** (doing this because I cannot access the API url from my location)
